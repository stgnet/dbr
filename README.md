Daily Bible Reading

ParseGutenberg.php
------------------

Uses the freely available KJV version from Gutenberg project to build
a statistics database of wordcounts per chapter and verse.


DailyChapters.php
-----------------

Use the chapter wordcount to create a daily bible reading plan that
that targets a running average words per day with a list of whole
chapters.  Currently the only supported mode is sequentially through
the bible, but the chapterlist array could be reordered to achieve
different results.
